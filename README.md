# terrarium_sensor

This project will serve as a blueprint for a small terrarium environmental/controller hub.

It consists of one ESP32 as the brain and you can connect up to: <br>
-5 DS18B20 temperature sensors <br>
-2 SHTxx temperature/humidity sensors <br>
-1 GUVA-S12D UV light sensor <br>
-1 OLED screen

We're planning to also release a GERBER file for custom PCBs.

In the future we're hoping to implement it smoothly with TerrariumPI in the future.
